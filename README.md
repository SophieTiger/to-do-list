# Today's To-Do's - the positive feedback app
The Today's To-Do's list is an application for all busy people out there that needs to have an easy way to structure the Today's To-Do's.
Sometimes life brings us so much that we need to do and structure, and most of that is not seen by anyone but ourselves. We accomplish many things without getting credit for it or a pat at the back.
This app gives the user a clear view of the number of tasks, completed tasks, as well as it gives positive feedback every time the user completes a task!
Built to use on the go, on the mobile phone, on a tablet or a computer, the app saves data to local storage so that the user can always trust it's reliability.

## Features
-   Header
    -   Featured at the top of the page, the header shows a background image of a desk with Pencils and Notebooks to give a feeling of organization and the purpose of the app.
    -   The header "Today's To-Do's" clearly states what this application is about.
    -   The Scoreboard with Number of tasks and Number of completed tasks shows a count of how many tasks there are on the list and how many tasks that have been completed.

-   To-Do Input and Delete all button
    -   The input field is pretty self explanatory with a placeholder text "Add task here" and a button with a plus-sign to add a task to the list. 
    -   There is also a Delete-button to clear all tasks on the list.

-   Adding tasks
    -   Task is added by writing something in the input field and then clicking the add-button with the plus sign or pressing the Enter key.
    -   There is also a small x-sign created at the right of the task, that can be used to remove the task from the list.
    -   The input field is cleared as soon as a task is added.

-   Checking off tasks
    -   A task can be checked off by clicking either the task text or the empty circle to the left of the task text.
    -   When a task is checked off the circle to the left becomes red with a check mark, and the text is striked through and greyed out.

    -   The number of completed tasks are incremented on the Scoreboard when tasks are checked.

    -   Once a task is checked off a toast notification appears with a positive feedback. There are four different messages that appear randomly:
    
        ![Message saying: Good Job!](/assets/images/good_job.png)

        ![Message saying: You're a star!](/assets/images/star.png)

        ![Message saying: Well done!](/assets/images/well_done.png)

        ![Message saying: You Rock!](/assets/images/you_rock.png)

-   Deleting tasks
    -   There are two ways of deleting tasks on the list:

        -   Clicking the x on the right hand side of the task removes that individual task from the list, and the Scoreboard of completed tasks is decremented by 1.

        -   Clicking the Delete All button at the bottom to the left of the list deletes all items on the list and sets the Scoreboard to 0.

-   Ensuring all actions are saved
